 Content Injection Playbook
Step	Action
Detect	- Monitor web server logs for unexpected parameters in requests.
- Use a WAF to flag suspicious input that modifies content.
Contain	- Quarantine affected web application by putting it behind maintenance mode.
- Block malicious IPs with firewall rules.
Eradicate	- Sanitize user input.
- Patch vulnerable endpoints and update frameworks.
- Review code for insecure eval or render functions.
Recover	- Restore clean version of the site from backup.
- Re-test endpoints for input validation.
- Increase monitoring for repeated attempts.

How it works:
Content Injection lets an attacker modify web page content by sending crafted input to an app that does not properly validate it â€” this can lead to defacement, fake forms, or phishing.
