CSRF & IDOR Lab Report

 Target:
PortSwigger Labs

 What I Did:
- Completed CSRF challenge by forging a POST request to change user password
- Found IDOR by changing a user ID in the URL to access another accountâ€™s data

 Key Points:
- Used Burp Repeater to test CSRF
- Identified missing access controls (IDOR)
