XSS Lab Report

Target:
DVWA - Reflected XSS Module

 What I Did:
- Opened DVWA (Docker)
- Tested input with `<script>alert(1)</script>`
- Captured request in Burp Suite
- Built `payload_injector.py` to automate payload injection
 Key Points:
- Explored input reflection
- Analyzed response with HTML output
- Learned impact of unsanitized input
