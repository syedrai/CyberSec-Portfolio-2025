
✅ 1. Preparation
This is what you do before any incident happens.

🔹 Goals:
Build an incident response plan

Harden systems (firewalls, patching, disable unused ports)

Train your team or yourself

Collect baseline logs (Sysmon, Windows Events)

Set up tools: SIEM (like Wazuh), antivirus, EDR (like CrowdStrike)

🧠 Real Example:
You install Sysmon to track process creation and network events. You also prepare a script to isolate a system, so you don’t waste time during an attack.

✅ 2. Identification
This is where you realize “Something is wrong.”

🔹 Goals:
Detect an anomaly or alert

Confirm it’s not a false positive

Classify the incident (malware, DDoS, data leak, insider attack)

🔍 How?
From alerts (SIEM/AV)

From logs (failed logins, weird traffic)

From users reporting issues

🧠 Real Example:
Your log monitoring system shows 50 failed SSH login attempts in 2 minutes → You check and find they’re coming from suspicious IPs → Brute-force attempt

✅ 3. Containment
Now that you found the threat, you stop it from spreading or causing more damage.

🔹 Goals:
Quarantine the system or account

Disconnect infected machines from the network

Block malicious IPs or domains

Capture volatile data (RAM, logs, running processes)

🧠 Real Example:
You block an IP in the firewall, isolate the affected laptop from Wi-Fi, and use taskkill or Process Explorer to terminate the malicious EXE.

✅ 4. Eradication
Now you clean up the mess the attacker left.

🔹 Goals:
Remove malware

Delete backdoors and persistence mechanisms

Patch vulnerabilities

Reset passwords

🧠 Real Example:
You remove a malicious registry startup key, delete the malware file, and uninstall a fake app the attacker installed.

✅ 5. Recovery
This is where you bring the system back to safe working condition.

🔹 Goals:
Restore clean backup

Monitor the system for reinfection

Slowly bring it back online

🧠 Real Example:
You restore a Windows server from a backup image taken 2 days before the attack and watch the network traffic for anomalies over 48 hours.

✅ 6. Lessons Learned
After everything is over — analyze what went wrong and how to prevent it in the future.

🔹 Goals:
Write a report (like what you’re building now)

Share Indicators of Compromise (IP, hash, domains)

Update detection tools

Improve your IR plan

Conduct a team debrief

🧠 Real Example:
You learn the user clicked a phishing link. You add that domain to your blocklist and train the user again. You also add email sandboxing to detect similar payloads in future.
