Day 9 ‚Äî XSS Payload Injector Project Report
===========================================

----------------------------------------------------
‚úÖ What was done:
----------------------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ I set up DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) using Docker.
‚Ä¢ I opened DVWA in the Burp Suite browser at http://127.0.0.1:8080.
‚Ä¢ I logged in and navigated to the "Reflected XSS" vulnerability page.
‚Ä¢ I intercepted a real vulnerable request to understand how it works.
‚Ä¢ I noted the GET request format and cookies (PHPSESSID, security).
‚Ä¢ I wrote a Python script (`payload_injector.py`) to automate sending multiple XSS payloads to the vulnerable parameter.
‚Ä¢ I ran the script in my Windows VM.
‚Ä¢ The script successfully injected payloads, captured responses, and saved them as `.html` files.
‚Ä¢ I verified the responses by opening the HTML files to see the payload execution.

----------------------------------------------------
‚úÖ Why automation is useful:
----------------------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ While you can test a single payload manually in the browser URL bar, automation lets you:
   - Fire multiple payloads fast.
   - Check response differences automatically.
   - Save results for reporting.
   - Practice building simple exploitation tools.
   - Use the same logic for real bug bounty or pentest situations.

This improves my Python, HTTP request crafting, and web vulnerability testing skills.

‚úÖ Python Payload Injector Script:
----------------------------------------------------

**Key points:**
- Uses `requests` to send GET requests.
- Handles cookies & headers.
- Loops through multiple payloads.
- Saves server responses to files for easy analysis.

# XSS Payload Injector

## üöÄ Description

This is a simple **Python automation script** to demonstrate how to inject **Reflected XSS payloads** into a vulnerable web application such as **DVWA** (Damn Vulnerable Web App).  
It sends test payloads, captures responses, and saves them as HTML files for analysis.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works

1. **Target:** The script targets the `xss_r` (Reflected XSS) page in DVWA by default.  
2. **Cookies:** You must provide a valid `PHPSESSID` and security level.  
3. **Payloads:** A list of common XSS payloads is injected into the `name` parameter.  
4. **Responses:** The script saves the HTML response for each payload so you can verify whether the payload executes in the browser.

---

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- Python 3  
- `requests` library

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install requests
Usage
Edit config in payload_injector.py:

TARGET_URL ‚Äî your DVWA or test lab URL.

COOKIES ‚Äî set your PHPSESSID and security level.

HEADERS ‚Äî adjust if needed.
Run the script:python payload_injector.py

Open the output .html files:

Check the files in your browser to see if the payload executed.
